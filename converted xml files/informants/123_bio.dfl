Peder was the son of miller and fiddler, “Kat-Søren,” and this led him to become a miller. His grandfather was a well-known folk healer and an exceptional story teller. Peder had learned many of his stories from this grandfather, but could not remember all of the stories he had heard from him. He lived in a house near the mill, and his sister kept house for him, as he had never been married. He was apparently a slob, and these habits carried over to the hygienic standards of his mill. He later moved to Vrold and then Dover. He was good story teller, but was often busy with fiddling for area parties. Tang Kristensen collected many of his stories in the millhouse, while the mill guests sat about drinking.
