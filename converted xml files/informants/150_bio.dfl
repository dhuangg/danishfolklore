Jens’s father was a cobbler and fiddler from Tveden and his mother was from Årestrup. He had always helped his father with shoemaking but, when he was strong enough, he also helped with the harvest. He had lived his whole life in the same area. He was a veteran of the 1848 war. His mother often sang the many ballads she knew, but did so mono-tonally. His father was a good singer, and Jens learned the melodies to his ballads from him. Jens had sung many ballads with highwayman and railroad guard Johan Pingel. Jens said that everything he told was drivel and nonsense which was not worth listening to. His wife did not like him telling such stories. Tang Kristensen mentions that “Heldigvis stikker hun jævnlig ud til naboerne”. He was an eager narrator, well-versed in the ways and mind-set of the old people, including the old dialect of the area. His sister also was able to sing several ballads for Tang Kristensen, but was not as good an informant. His son from his second marriage, Anders Bundgaards, became a famous sculptor.
